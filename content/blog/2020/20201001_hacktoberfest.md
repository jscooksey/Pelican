It's back around to October again and [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is of course up and running. I enjoyed [my first involvement with Hacktoberfest](https://justincooksey.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2019/) in 2019 but I didn't complete enough pull request for the month. Will I make it this year?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a great idea. It got me contributing, and keen to try again next year, but I hope to keep its intent rolling through the year.

As before in 2019, my thanks go to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV](https://dev.to/) for this great initiative.
