Iâ€™m a Coder and IT Network Engineer, Father, and Photographer.

I'm based out of Newcastle, Australia, and have been involved in the industry for over 26yrs primarily supporting small to medium businesses in the area, as well managing a privately hosted virtual server system. As part of my role in supporting this data center system, I write code on a regular basis utilising Python, JavaScript, SQL, and PowerShell. It is a Microsoft world in the business user end.

I'm also continuously developing my skills with the above languages as well as frameworks such as GatsbyJS, ReactJS, and GraphQL.
