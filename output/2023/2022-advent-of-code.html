    <p>As usual I remembered the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code</a> after it had started, but never the less I got stuck in to it around day 10 (10th December 20222). However I never got past the day 7 stage 1 puzzle but not because I couldn't, but rather I just fell in to that busy time of year, and didn't spend the time trying to keep up.</p>
<p>Well there is nothing to stop you from continuing on so I'll see if I can get back in to it in (ummm...) February 2023! (Im sitting here shaking my head)</p>
<p>If you havent ever heard about it, you should <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">take a look</a>. It's a series of puzzles, relased as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calender</a>, that you solve by wwriting up the code to find the answers. 2 puzzles are released every day from December 1st through Decmber 25th that you solve to help the elves undertake Christmas tasks. You can use any language you like, and its not the code you write that you progress with, just the correct answers you must get from that code.</p>
<p>So I'll continue on, no doubt it wont all get solve in 2 months, but tis still a fun task to keep you learning.</p>
